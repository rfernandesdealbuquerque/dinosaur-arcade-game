# Repository DinosaurGame - Digital Systems course at Duke University

## üí† Course

The objective of this course was to learn advanced logic and computer hardware design through a hands-on approach.

## üéì What I learned?

* Advanced Boolean Algebra
* Advanced digital logic design
* Hardware Description Languages - Verilog
* Memory elements in-depth
* 5-stage pipelined Processor/CPU design
* FPGA programming with Vivado
* Hardware, Software and electronic components integration

## üöÄ Final Project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 1

* Designed a 32-bit Carry LookAhead Adder ALU, a 32-bit Register File with 32 registers and a 32-bit Multiplier/Divider unit, all in Verilog.
* Designed a 32-bit MIPS like architecture 5-stage pipelined processor in Verilog.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 2

* Created a running Dinosaur arcade game in Verilog. Implemented in a FPGA board with Vivado using the processor designed in Phase 1 and a VGA screen.
